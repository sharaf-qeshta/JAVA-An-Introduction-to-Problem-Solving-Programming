/**
 * 4. Complete and fully test the class Characteristic that Exercise 5 describes.
 * Include the following methods:
 * • getDescription—returns the description of this characteristic.
 * • getRating—returns the rating of this characteristic.
 * • getCompatability(Characteristic otherRating)—returns the
 * compatibility measure of two matching characteristics, or zero if the
 * descriptions do not match.
 * • getCompatibilityMeasure(Characteristic otherRating)—a private
 * method that returns a compatibility measure as a double value using the
 * formula
 * when both ratings are nonzero; m is zero if either rating is zero. (Recall
 * from Exercise 5 that the constructor sets the rating to zero, indicating
 * that it has not yet been determined.)
 * • isMatch(Characteristic otherRating)—a private method that
 * returns true if the descriptions match.
