/**
 * 6. Create a class MarksObtained that can be used to record the marks of
 * subjects of the student in a school. The class has the attributes
 * • marksInSubject—the marks of a student in a subject
 * • totalMarksObt—the total marks obtained by a student in all subjects as
 * a static variable
 * The class has the following methods:
 * • increaseMarksInSubject—adds given marks to the subject and
 * increases the value of totalMarksObt
 * • decreaseMarksInSubject—subtracts given marks from the subject and
 * decreases the value of totalMarksObt, ensuring that marksInSubject
 * does not go below zero
 * • getMarks—returns the marks in a subject of the student
 * • getTotalMarks—a static method that returns the total marks of the student
