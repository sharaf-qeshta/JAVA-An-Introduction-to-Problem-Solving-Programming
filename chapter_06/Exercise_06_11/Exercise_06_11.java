/**
 * 11. Create a class Android whose objects have unique data. The class has the
 * following attributes:
 * • tag—a static integer that begins at 1 and changes each time an instance
 * is created
 * • name—a string that is unique for each instance of this class
 * Android has the following methods:
 * • Android—a default constructor that sets the name to "Bob" concatenated
 * with the value of tag. After setting the name, this constructor changes
 * the value of tag by calling the private method changeTag.
 * • getName—returns the name portion of the invoking object.
 * • isPrime(n)—a private static method that returns true if n is prime—
 * that is, if it is not divisible by any number from 2 to n − 1.
 * • changeTag—a private static method that replaces tag with the next
 * prime number larger than the current value of tag.
