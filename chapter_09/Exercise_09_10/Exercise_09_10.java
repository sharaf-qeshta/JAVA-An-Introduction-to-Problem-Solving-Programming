/**
 * 10. Suppose you are going to create an object used to count the number of
 * books in a bag. We impose a condition that the number of books in the
 * bag can never be zero or negative. Create a BooksCounter class having
 * three public methods:
 * • removeBook—removes one book from the bag
 * • addBook—adds one book to the bag
 * • getBooksCount—returns the number of books in the bag
 * If removeBook would make the number of books zero or less than zero,
 * throw a ZeroOrNegativeCounterException.
