/**
 * 3. Develop an algorithm for a simple game of guessing at a secret five-digit
 * code. When the user enters a guess at the code, the program returns two
 * values: the number of digits in the guess that are in the correct position
 * and the sum of those digits. For example, if the secret code is 53840, and
 * the user guesses 83241, the digits 3 and 4 are in the correct position. Thus,
 * the program should respond with 2 and 7. Allow the user to guess a fixed
 * number of times.
