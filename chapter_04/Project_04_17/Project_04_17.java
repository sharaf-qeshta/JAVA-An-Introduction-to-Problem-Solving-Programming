/**
 * 17. You have an augmented reality game in which you catch Edoc and acquire
 * Edoc candy. You need 12 candies to evolve an Edoc into a Margorp. An
 * evolution earns you back one candy. Each evolution also earns you 500
 * experience points. An Edoc or Margorp can each be transferred for one
 * Edoc candy. In support of the gameâ€™s players, write an Edoc calculator
 * program that inputs the number of Edoc you have caught and the
 * number of Edoc candies in your possession. You can assume the initial
 * number of Margorps is 0. The program should output the maximum
 * number of experience points you can earn through transfers and
 * evolutions. After Edocs evolve into Margorps, your program should
 * consider if transferring the Margorps will result in enough candy to
 * evolve even more Edoc.
 * For example, if you start with 71 candies and 53 Edoc, the program could
 * output the following. Note that there are many other sequences of transfers
 * and evolutions, with possibly a different final number of Edoc and
 * Margorp, but the total number of experience points should be the same
 * (the max possible):
 * Transfer 37 Edoc and 0 Margorp resulting in
 *  108 candy, 16 Edoc, and 0 Margorp
 * Evolve 9 Edoc to get 4500 experience points and resulting in
 *  9 candy, 7 Edoc, and 9 Margorp
 * Transfer 0 Edoc and 9 Margorp resulting in
 *  18 candy, 7 Edoc, and 0 Margorp
 * Evolve 1 Edoc to get 500 experience points and resulting in
 *  7 candy, 6 Edoc, and 1 Margorp
 * Transfer 4 Edoc and 1 Margorp resulting in
 *  12 candy, 2 Edoc, and 0 Margorp
 * Evolve 1 Edoc to get 500 experience points and resulting in
 *  1 candy, 1 Edoc, and 1 Margorp
 * Total experience points = 5500
