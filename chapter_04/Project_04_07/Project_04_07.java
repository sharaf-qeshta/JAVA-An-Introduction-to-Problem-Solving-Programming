/**
 * 7. Write a program that simulates a bouncing ball by computing its height in
 * feet at each second as time passes on a simulated clock. At time zero, the
 * ball begins at height zero and has an initial velocity supplied by the user.
 * (An initial velocity of at least 100 feet per second is a good choice.) After
 * each second, change the height by adding the current velocity; then subtract
 * 32 from the velocity. If the new height is less than zero, multiply both the
 * height and the velocity by âˆ’0.5 to simulate the bounce. Stop at the fifth
 * bounce. The output from your program should have the following form:
 * Enter the initial velocity of the ball: 100
 * Time: 0 Height: 0.0
 * Time: 1 Height: 100.0
 * Time: 2 Height: 168.0
 * Time: 3 Height: 204.0
 * Time: 4 Height: 208.0
 * Time: 5 Height: 180.0
 * Time: 6 Height: 120.0
 * Time: 7 Height: 28.0
 * Bounce!
 * Time: 8 Height: 48.0
