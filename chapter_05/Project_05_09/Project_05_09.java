 * 9. Rewrite the Dog class given in Listing 5.1 by utilizing the information
 * and encapsulation principles described in Section 5.2. The new version
 * should include accessor and mutator methods. Also define an equals
 * method for the class that returns true if the dogâ€™s name, age, and breed
 * match the same variables for the other object that is being compared.
 * Include a main method to test the functionality of the new Dog class.
