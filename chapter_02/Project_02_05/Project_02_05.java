/**
 * 5. Write a program that determines the change to be dispensed from a
 * vending machine. An item in the machine can cost between 25 cents and
 * a dollar, in 5-cent increments (25, 30, 35, â€¦ , 90, 95, or 100), and the
 * machine accepts only a single dollar bill to pay for the item. For example,
 * a possible dialogue with the user might be
 * Enter price of item
 * (from 25 cents to a dollar, in 5-cent increments): 45
 * You bought an item for 45 cents and gave me a dollar,
 * so your change is
 * 2 quarters,
 * 0 dimes, and
 * 1 nickel.
