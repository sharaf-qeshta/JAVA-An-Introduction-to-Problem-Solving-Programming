/**
 * 4. Create the classes RightTriangle and Rectangle, each of which is derived
 * from the abstract class ShapeBase in Listing 8.19. Then derive a class
 * Square from the class Rectangle. Each of these three derived classes will
 * have two additional methods to calculate area and circumference, as well
 * as the inherited methods. Do not forget to override the method drawHere.
 * Give your classes a reasonable complement of constructors and accessor
 * methods. The Square class should include only one dimension, the side,
 * and should automatically set the height and width to the length of the
 * side. You can use dimensions in terms of the character width and line
 * spacing even though they are undoubtedly unequal, so a square will not
 * look square (just as a Rectangle object, as discussed in this chapter, wonâ€™t
 * look square). Write a driver program that tests all your methods.
