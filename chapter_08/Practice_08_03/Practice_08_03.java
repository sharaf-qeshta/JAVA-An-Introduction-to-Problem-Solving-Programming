/**
 * 3. Create a base class called Vehicle that has the manufacturerâ€™s name (type
 * String), number of cylinders in the engine (type int), and owner (type
 * Person given in Listing 8.1). Then create a class called Truck that is derived
 * from Vehicle and has additional properties: the load capacity in tons
 * (type double, since it may contain a fractional part) and towing capacity
 * in tons (type double). Give your classes a reasonable complement of
 * constructors and accessor methods, and an equals method as well. Write
 * a driver program (no pun intended) that tests all your methods.
