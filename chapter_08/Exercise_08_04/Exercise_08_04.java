 * 4. Suppose we want to implement a drawing program that creates various shapes
 * using keyboard characters. Implement an abstract base class DrawableShape
 * that knows the center (two integer values) and the color (a string) of the
 * object. Give appropriate accessor methods for the attributes. You should also
 * have a mutator method that moves the object by a given amount.
