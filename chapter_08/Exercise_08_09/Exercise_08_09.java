 * 9. Derive a class FullCourseFee from FeeComputer, as described in the

 * hourly fee. It should not override any of the methods. Then derive a class
 * CrashCourseFee from FeeComputer that overrides the getFee method.
 * The new method should return the amount returned by the base class
 * method plus 10000.
