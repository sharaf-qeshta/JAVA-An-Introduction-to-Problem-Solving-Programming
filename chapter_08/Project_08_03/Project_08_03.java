/**
 * 3. Define two classes, Patient and Billing, whose objects are records for a
 * clinic. Derive Patient from the class Person given in Listing 8.1. A Patient
 * record has the patientâ€™s name (defined in the class Person) and
 * identification number (use the type String). A Billing object will contain
 * a Patient object and a Doctor object (from Practice Program 2). Give
 * your classes a reasonable complement of constructors and accessor
 * methods, and an equals method as well. First write a driver program to
 * test all your methods, then write a test program that creates at least two
 * patients, at least two doctors, and at least two Billing records and then
 * displays the total income from the Billing records.
