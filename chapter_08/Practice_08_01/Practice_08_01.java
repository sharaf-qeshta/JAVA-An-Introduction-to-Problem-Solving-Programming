/**
 * 1. Define a class named Employee whose objects are records for employees.
 * Derive this class from the class Person given in Listing 8.1. An employee
 * record inherits an employeeâ€™s name from the class Person. In addition, an
 * employee record contains an annual salary represented as a single value of
 * type double, a hire date that gives the year hired as a single value of type
 * int, and an identification number that is a value of type String. Give
 * your class a reasonable complement of constructors, accessor methods,
 * and mutator methods, as well as an equals method. Write a program to
 * fully test your class definition
