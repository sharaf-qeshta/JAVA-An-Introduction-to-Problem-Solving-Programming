/**
 * 7. The following formula gives a rough estimate of your blood alcohol
 * content (BAC) and is derived from formulas posted by the National
 * Highway Traffic Safety Administration:
 *  BAC = (4.136 x numDrinks x ouncesAlcohol) / (weight)
 *  numDrinks is the number of drinks ingested.
 *  ouncesAlcohol is the number of ounces of alcohol per drink
 *  weight is the weight of the drinker in pounds
 * Note that this formula gives only a rough estimate and doesnâ€™t include
 * your metabolism, time spent drinking, gender differences, etc. Write a
 * program that calculates the blood alcohol content of someone drinking
 * Jagerbombs. Assume that there are 0.55 ounces of alcohol in one
 * Jagerbomb. Pick values of your own choosing for the number of drinks
 * and the weight. Also output whether or not the person would be legally
 * intoxicated in your state.
