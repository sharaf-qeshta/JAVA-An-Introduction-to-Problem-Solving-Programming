 * 3. Suppose you are writing a program that asks the user to give a yes-or-no
 * response. Assume that the program reads the userâ€™s response into the
 * String variable response.
 * a. If response is yes or y, set the boolean variable accept to true;
 * otherwise, set it to false.
 * b. How would you change the code so that it will also accept Yes and Y?
