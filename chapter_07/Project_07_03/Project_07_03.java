/**
 * 3. Add a method bubbleSort to the class ArraySorter, as given in
 * Listing 7.10, that performs a bubble sort of an array. The bubble sort
 * algorithm examines all adjacent pairs of elements in the array from the
 * beginning to the end and interchanges any two elements that are out of
 * order. Each interchange makes the array more sorted than it was, until it is
 * entirely sorted. The algorithm in pseudocode follows:
 * Bubble sort algorithm to sort an array a
 * Repeat the following until the array a is sorted:
 * for (index = 0; index <a.length âˆ’ 1; index++)
 *  if (a[index] > a[index + 1])
 *  Interchange the values of a[index] and a[index + 1].
 * The bubble sort algorithm usually requires more time than other sorting
 * methods.
