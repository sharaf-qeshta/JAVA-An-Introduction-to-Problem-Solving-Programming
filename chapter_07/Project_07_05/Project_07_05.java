/**
 * 5. The class TimeBook in Listing 7.14 is not really finished. Complete the
 * definition of this class in the way described in the text. In particular, be
 * sure to add a default constructor, as well as set and get methods that
 * change or retrieve each of the instance variables and each indexed variable
 * of each array instance variable. Be sure you replace the stub setHours with
 * a method that obtains values from the keyboard. You should also define a
 * private method having two int parameters that displays the first parameter
 * in the number of spaces given by a second parameter. The extra spaces not
 * filled by the first parameter are to be filled with blanks. This will let you
 * write each array element in exactly four spaces, for example, and so will
 * allow you to display a neat rectangular arrangement of array elements. Be
 * sure that the main method in Listing 7.14 works correctly with these new
 * methods. Also, write a separate test program to test all the new methods.
 * (Hint: To display an int value n in a fixed number of spaces, use Integer.
 * toString(n) to convert the number to a string value, and then work with
 * the string value. This method is discussed in Chapter 6 in the section
 * “Wrapper Classes.”)
