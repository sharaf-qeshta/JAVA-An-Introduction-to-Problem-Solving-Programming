/**
 * 11. Suppose we are selling bouquets of flowers for an event. We have six kinds
 * of flowers to sell: white rose, red rose, daisy, tulip, lily, and jasmine. We will
 * record a customerâ€™s order as an array of six integers, representing the number
 * of bouquets of each kind of flower. Write a static method firstOrder that
 * takes a combined order and the second order and returns an array that
 * represents the first order. For example, if combinedOrder contains 10, 12,
 * 15, 20, 25, and 23, and secondOrder contains 8, 10, 5, 9, 13, and 15, then
 * the method should return an array containing 2, 2, 10, 11, 12, and 8.
