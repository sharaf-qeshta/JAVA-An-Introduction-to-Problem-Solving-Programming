/**
 * 21. Write a static method blur(double[][]picture) that you could use on
 * a part of a picture file to obscure a detail such as a personâ€™s face or a
 * license plate number. This method computes the weighted averages of
 * the values in picture and returns them in a new two-dimensional
 * array. To find a weighted average of a group of numbers, you count
 * some of them more than others. Thus, you multiply each item by its
 * weight, add these products together, and divide the result by the sum
 * of the weights.
 * For each element in picture, compute the weighted average of the
 * element and its immediate neighbors. Store the result in a new two dimensional
 * array in the same position that the element occupies in
 * picture. This new array is the one the method returns.
 * The neighbors of an element in picture can be above, below, to the left
 * of, and to the right of it, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. So
 * each weighted average in the new array will be a combination of up to nine
 * values from the array picture. A corner value will use only four values: itself
 * and three neighbors. An edge value will use only six values: itself and five
 * neighbors. But an interior value will use nine values: itself and eight
 * neighbors. So you will need to treat the corners and edges separately from
 * the other cells.
 * The weights to use are:
 * 1 2 1
 * 2 4 2
 * 1 2 1
 * The element itself has the highest weight of 4, the horizontal and vertical
 * neighbors have a weight of 2, and the diagonal neighbors have a weight
 * of 1.
 * For example, suppose the values in picture are
 *
 *      1.2 1.3 4.5 6.0 2.7
 *      1.7 3.3 4.4 10.5 17.0
 *      1.1 4.5 2.1 25.3 9.2
 *      1.0 9.5 8.3 2.9 2.1
 *
 * and the new array is called result. In assigning weights, we will arbitrarily
 * start with an element and consider neighbors in a clockwise direction.
 * Thus, the interior value in result[1][1]is equal to
 *
 *  4(3.3) + 2(4.4) + 1(2.1) + 2(4.5) + 1(1.1) + 2(1.7) + 1(1.2) + 2(1.3) + 1(4.5)
 *  / 4 + 2 + 1 + 2
 *
 *
 *  Note that picture[0][0] has fewer neighbors than an interior value such
 * as picture[1][1]. The same is true for an edge value such as picture[0]
 * [1]. Thus, the edge value in result[0][1]is equal to
 *
 * 4(1.3) + 2(4.5) + 1(4.4) + 2(3.3) + 1(1.7) + 2(1.2)
 * / 4 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2
 *
 * The final array, result, would be
 *      1.57 2.44 4.60 6.73 7.48
 *      1.98 2.87 5.97 10.37 12.01
 *      2.63 4.09 7.48 11.40 11.58
 *      3.30 5.73 7.67 7.86 6.43
