/**
 * 2. Write a program in a class StudentCount that counts the number of
 * students who obtained marks above 50% in a test. Read an integer i from
 * the keyboard and then create an array of double values of size i. Read i
 * values representing the studentsâ€™ marks from the keyboard and place them
 * into the array. Find the highest and the lowest among these marks. Then
 * count the students who obtained more than 50% given as 500. Display
 * this count and the marks of those students.
