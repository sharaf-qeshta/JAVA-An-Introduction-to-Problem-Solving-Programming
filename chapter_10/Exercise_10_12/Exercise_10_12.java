/**
 * 12. Suppose that you have a binary file that contains numbers whose type is
 * either int or double. You donâ€™t know the order of the numbers in the file,
 * but their order is recorded in a string at the beginning of the file. The
 * string is composed of the letters i (for int) and d (for double) in the order
 * of the types of the subsequent numbers. The string is written using the
 * method writeUTF.
 * For example, the string "iddiiddd" indicates that the file contains eight
 * values, as follows: one integer, followed by two doubles, followed by two
 * integers, followed by three doubles. Read this binary file and create a new
 * text file of the values, written one to a line.
